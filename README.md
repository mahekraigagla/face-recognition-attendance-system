The Face Recognition Attendance System is an automated solution designed to mark attendance by recognizing faces using computer vision. It leverages OpenCV and machine learning techniques to identify students or employees and records their attendance efficiently. The system captures face images, trains a recognition model, and marks attendance automatically based on face recognition.

Features

1)Face Registration: Register new faces with ID and name.

2)Image Capture: Capture up to 50 face images per user (configurable).

3)Face Training: Train the model using the captured images.

4)Automatic Attendance: Mark attendance using face recognition.

5)Attendance Records: Generate and store attendance records in CSV format.

6)Attendance Viewing: View recorded attendance in a tabular format.
